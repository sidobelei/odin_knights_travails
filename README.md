# knights_travails

The purpose of this project was to build a function, "knights_moves." This function shows the shortest possible path to get from one square to another by outputting all squares that a knight will stop along the way. Utilizing an adjacency list and a breadth-first search approach, a path and the number of steps to reach the target square were calculated.Â
